# Plants vs. Zombies 2 Level Editor

**Plants vs. Zombies 2 Level Editor**, also referred to as **Level Editor**, **PvZ2: LE** or simply **LE**, is a Windows GUI tool for generating PvZ2 levels.
It is written in C++ using SFML and it provides essential functionality for level creation.

## üõ† State of Development
<a name="Development"></a>

The project has been archived after being completed and can now be accessed for reference and portfolio purposes. This repository has two branches:

* [``2.0.x``](https://github.com/blazingzephyr/level-editor/tree/2.0.x) branch is the complete stable version of the tool.
* [``2.1.x``](https://github.com/blazingzephyr/level-editor/tree/2.1.x) branch contains work in progress for the next major reimplementation of LE. However, the update has been canceled, so the code is extremely unfinished and unstable.

## üìù Goals
<a name="Goals"></a>

Originally, when starting this project, I persuaded the following goals:

* Remaking an old low-quality tool I made back in 2020 (Currently referred to as ``1.0``).
* Improving my skills in C++.
* Learning a new multimedia library, that being SFML.
* (Later) making custom UI on SFML without any third-party libraries.

## üìÉ Features & Capabilities
<a name="Features"></a>

Set of features, supported by the tool:

* Core features, such as JSON export.
* Settings for personalization:
  * Fullscreen and Windowed modes with widescreen resolutions (320:180, 640:360, 1280:720, 1920:1080).
  * Custom UI layout support (limited; only Standard layout is included).
  * UI translation support (English and Russian translations are included).
  * UI theming support ('New' and 'Old' themes are included).
  * Miscellaneous secondary options:
    * BGM and Sound Volume adjustment.
    * Export folder location.
    * Etc.
